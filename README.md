### Description:

Pig dice is a dice game where players takes turns rolling a single die. They can roll as many times as they like, adding up their total each time unless they decide to pass or roll a one where they lose their total.

### Example:

The first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.
